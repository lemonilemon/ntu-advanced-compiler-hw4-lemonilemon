## Build

I have included the built plugin in the repository.
If you want to run the pass, you should run the following code:

```bash
cd ntu-advanced-compiler-hw4-lemonilemon
bash build.sh
```

## Testing

I have written a script in `./tests` folder to test the pass.
You can run the following code to test the pass:

```bash
cd ntu-advanced-compiler-hw4-lemonilemon
bash tests/test.sh
```

Then you can see the test results output in `stdout`.
And it will also generate a log file `test_results.log` to record the test results.
